# General Information About LaTeX

LaTeX is a typesetting system commonly used for technical and scientific documentation. It allows users to focus on the content, while LaTeX takes care of the layout and formatting.

## General Document Layout for a LaTeX File

A typical LaTeX document consists of the following parts:

- **Preamble**: This includes the document class and packages.
- **Document Environment**: The content of the document is placed between `\begin{document}` and `\end{document}`.
- **Title, Author, and Date**: You can specify the title, author, and the creation date using specific LaTeX commands.
  
### LaTeX Source Code Example:

```latex
\documentclass{article}  % Specifies the document class

% Preamble: Import packages (if any)
\usepackage[utf8]{inputenc}

% Title, author, and date
\title{Introduction to LaTeX}
\author{John Doe}
\date{\today}  % Automatically sets the current date

\begin{document}

\maketitle  % Generates the title

% Your content goes here
This is an example of a LaTeX document structure.

\end{document}
