### Git `status` Command

The `git status` command displays the state of the working directory and the staging area. It shows which changes have been staged, which haven't, and which files aren't being tracked by Git. This helps in preparing for a commit by showing file modifications and new files.

#### Common Options:
1. `--short` : Displays a brief version of the status.
2. `--branch` : Displays branch information and the number of commits ahead/behind.
3. `--ignored` : Shows ignored files as well.

#### Example of running the command:

```bash
git status --short
```

*This example shows the status of the repository in a condensed format, useful for quick overviews.*
